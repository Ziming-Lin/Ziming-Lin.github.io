## About the Dashboard

I have recently learnt that besides the usual preattentive attributes (e.g. shape, colour and size) which determine what captures the mind of the audience, there is also motion. Instead of abrupt changes in location and size of the marks on a Tableau dashboard/chart, Tableau's pages feature allows for smooth transitions of the marks and therefore enhances the audience's comprehension process.

The dashboard is available [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ziming.lin/viz/Transitions-EvolutionofMankind/MainDashboard){:target="_blank"}.
