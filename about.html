    I am a fan of big data analytics and am currently exploring a mid-career switch. Although I majored in chemical and biomolecular engineering, I took the plunge to enter Singapore's public service sector early in my career mainly to improve my communication skills.
    At Housing and Development Board (HDB), I was exposed to numerous tasks and responsibilities involving communication with internal and external stakeholders and I believe I have benefitted greatly from my 6-year stint there.

<p align="justify">
    When I left HDB, a huge part of my role was to tackle mortgage arrears through which I found myself facing challenges that could certainly use the help of data analysis. And with the pandemic at its peak, I left the job to give myself time to work on this skillset, amongst many other things (such as my personal fitness which was severely lacking due to a prior shoulder operation).
</p>
    
<p align="justify">
    Since leaving HDB, I have had many experiences previously unachievable because of the lack of time. These include 3D printing and 3D modeling, learning and undergoing physiotherapy, opening a webstore, streaming video games, touching the basics of music production, and a few more.
